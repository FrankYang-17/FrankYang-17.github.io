# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by Prof. Xuejun Yang and Prof. Wenjing Yang. I earned my B.S. degree from China University of Geosciences in 2023. Prior to this, I served in the People's Liberation Army of China from 2017 to 2019.

My main research interest focus on foundation models for multimodal learning. I am also interested in the application of multimodal learning in embodied AI. Currently I am working on multimodal pre-training models and their applications in various tasks.

*If you are interested in partnering on research projects, offering internship opportunities or exchange programs, I would be thrilled to connect with you.* :)
